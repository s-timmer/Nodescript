Purpose: Brief technical writer + create content roadmap for activation.

Core problem: "Users often cite that they don't understand, don't know, or can't find the right content to get started."

Content pillars:
1. Onboarding & Activation — tutorials for first-time users, templates for quick wins, improved docs
2. Retention & Education — advanced guides, modular workflows, creative applications
3. SEO & Marketing — blog posts targeting automation keywords, developer thought leadership

Content types: tutorials (beginner→advanced), templates, blog posts, documentation, video content

Distribution: website hub, Reddit ads, Twitter/LinkedIn, Instagram demos, future community platforms (Dev.to, HN, Stack Overflow)

Tone: developer-focused, approachable, nimble/startup-like, light humor

Phasing:
- Immediate (1-3 months): Quick win tutorials, documentation cleanup, Reddit/Twitter
- Medium (3-12 months): Advanced tutorials, SEO blog posts, template repository
- Long-term (1+ years): Community-driven content pipeline

Technical writer brief:
- Primary goal: clear actionable content addressing onboarding gaps
- Expect collaborative + autonomous work style
- Success metrics: reduced time-to-first-success, increased credit usage
- Benchmarks: Pipedream, n8n, Gumloop

Research plan includes:
