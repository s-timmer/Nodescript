Insights and Next Steps for Product Design — slide deck (18 pages). Source: PDF upload.

Synthesis presentation pulling together research insights and recommending design direction.

Workshop Consensus (Hybrid Approach):
- Amplify core strengths (visual programming + instant deployment)
- AI as natural extension (not pivot)
- Enterprise scalability as supporting pillar
- This was the resolved team position after evaluating three strategic paths

Key Insights Synthesized:
1. Visual development power is the genuine differentiator — not AI, not enterprise features
2. AI orchestration is a natural fit but shouldn't be the primary identity
3. Enterprise scale comes organically from Ubio's internal needs
4. The product needs to get better at communicating its value, not fundamentally change what it is

Design Strategy Implications:
- Brand evolution: "powerful but confusing" → "powerful and approachable"
- User progression framework should guide all design decisions
- Progressive disclosure: don't overwhelm newcomers, don't limit experts
- Quick wins + guided paths for activation
- Advanced features surfaced at the right moments

Next Steps Recommended:
1. Implement Quick Win tutorial system
2. Build example gallery organized by use case
3. Improve first-run experience with guided onboarding
4. Create multiple learning paths for different user types
5. Address production readiness gaps (error handling, monitoring)
6. Develop landing page with clear value proposition and trust signals

Team Alignment:
- Dan's summary: "A very efficient developer tool that hopefully developers like using, that has AI in it and is usable by enterprise customers"
- Acknowledged this sounds vague but felt it was accurate
- The honest framing was preferred over a forced narrowing
