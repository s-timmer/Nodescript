UBO.AI strategy and positioning meeting, May 20 2025.
Attendees: Adar, Boris, Jonny, Marcus, Norman, Sjors. Source: Google Doc.

Strategic discussion about UBO.AI brand, website, and how to position AI/automation capabilities.

Key topics:
- Debate: separate ubo.ai domain vs integrating AI story into main website
- NodeScript is part of UBO's "vertically integrated attack stack" (custom hardware, scripts, proxy networks, NodeScript, autopilot, QA tools)
- Enterprise customers (Google, Travelocity, Skyscanner) need reliable, scalable automation
- A3 (Agent-based automation) emerging as future product direction
- Content-first strategy: publishing demos and use cases matters more than perfect website
- Enterprise sales cycle: customers need multiple proofs of concept before expanding
- UBO positioning: middle ground between AI startups (lack scale) and big tech (don't prioritize this)

Note: Less directly about NodeScript product, more about the broader company context NodeScript sits within.
