Strategic planning meeting for external developer recruitment and interviews, Jan 27 2025.
Attendees: Boris, Dan, Jo, Norman, Sjors. Source: Google Doc.

Key topics: Refining ICP, research goals, screening criteria, payment models, recruitment channels. Significant debate about whether to focus on professional developers vs non-programmer technical users vs hobbyists.

Key insights:
- Core value prop tension: NodeScript allows entering complexity (reusable nodes/modules) while remaining simpler than traditional coding
- ICP debate: Boris advocates "ideal" customers who dive deep and experiment; Dan prioritizes technical developers; consensus: developers who can freely build without hand-holding
- Free tier strategy: developers use NodeScript for routine tasks (HTTP, base64, random strings) without paying, creating path to paid production use
- Market validation signal: if external devs don't mention AI features independently, the AI market may not exist for this product
- Broader personas: should interview "creative developers" and non-programmer technical hobbyists
- Screening: filter for people willing to experiment/tweak rather than wanting pre-built templates
- Enterprise gaps: monitoring, logging, error handling, metrics collection are weak spots for production workloads
