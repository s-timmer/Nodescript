NodeScript Activation Research — slide deck. Source: PDF upload.

Research on user activation patterns and onboarding bottlenecks.

Key findings:
- Activation bottleneck sits between "landing on dashboard" and "aha moment"
- More precise than "blank canvas" framing — it's about the gap between seeing the interface and understanding what's possible
- Users who get 1:1 guidance convert well, confirming product value exists

User learning styles identified:
- Video learners (want walkthroughs)
- Reverse engineers (want to open existing workspaces and trace dependencies)
- Trial-and-error experimenters (want examples they can break and rebuild)
- Documentation readers (want structured reference material)

The Paradigm Shift Problem:
- JavaScript developers face cognitive load translating imperative thinking to graph-based composition
- Some resort to code nodes rather than mastering visual composition
- Deeper than UI learning — requires mental model shift

Hidden Features Problem:
- Users consistently didn't discover frames, loops, conditional logic
- Variable creation in graphs was unknown
- Reusable nodes/modules weren't found
- Features exist but are poorly signposted

Production Readiness Gaps:
- Error handling too weak for production use
- No traditional logging or stack traces
- Monitoring and debugging painful for deployed systems
- Steep gap between free-tier casual use and production

Template Trap insight:
- Pre-built templates attract wrong users (want off-the-shelf)
- Ideal users tweak and experiment with templates
- Confirmed Boris's "experimenter" filter

Bright Spot — Liam:
- Became highly active paid user
- Built sophisticated AI content platform
- Pattern: pushed through friction → found deep value
- Question: how to lower friction without filtering out power users
