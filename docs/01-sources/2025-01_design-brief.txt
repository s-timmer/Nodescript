Original NodeScript design brief. Source: Google Doc (Nodescript design brief).

Company mission: "Make the web programmable by anyone."

Experience goals:
1. It just works — web-based, shareable via link, runs immediately
2. In it together — easy to share/collaborate with non-technical stakeholders
3. Extendible forever — modular architecture, every graph can become a reusable module
4. Exploration encouraged — immediate results let you learn while coding

Target audiences:
- Developers: should see clear benefits and be tempted to use on a side project
- Power users: "string stuff together until it works" / "plays with lego" — can alter existing graphs

Original goals:
- Get 5 developers outside Ubio to build something useful
- Get average 8/10 ease of use rating
- Get positive recommendation rate
- Have one critical piece of Ubio code running on it

Key stakeholders: Boris (lead dev), Marcus (domain expert), Emma (product manager), Sjors (designer)
