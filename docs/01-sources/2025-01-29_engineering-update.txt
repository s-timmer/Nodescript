14:13-14:15
Thank you.


14:15-14:17
Thank you.


14:17-14:23
I hope if I recommend someone then make it past your screening because that would be quite


14:23-14:24
nice.


14:24-14:28
Yeah, look, they wouldn't let me.


14:28-14:30
Yeah, I will shortlist them.


14:30-14:32
Any feedback from anyone, any questions on that?


14:32-14:33
Okay, that's good.


14:33-14:36
It's going to be good information to get.


14:36-14:40
If anyone has anyone in mind, it might be a great addition to those interviews.


14:40-14:42
Just let us know because we'll just start filling up the list, I guess, soon.


14:42-14:43
All right.


14:43-14:43
I think that's good.


14:43-14:44
I think that's really good work, Shor.


14:44-14:45
I know we talked about this on Monday.


14:45-14:46
I think it's all good.


14:46-14:46
I think it's all good.


14:46-14:47
I think it can only help.


14:47-14:48
I think it's a good use of the investment.


14:48-14:49
I'll work with you in terms of the outreach and trying to find these people.


14:49-14:50
I think we're trying to find these people.


14:50-14:51
I think we're trying to find them.


14:51-14:52
I think we're trying to find them.


14:52-14:53
I think we're trying to find them.


14:53-14:54
I think we're trying to find them.


14:54-14:55
I think we're trying to find them.


14:55-14:56
I think we're trying to find them.


14:56-14:57
I think we're trying to find them.


14:57-14:58
I think we're trying to find them.


14:58-14:59
I think we're trying to find them.


14:59-15:00
I think we're trying to find them.


15:00-15:01
I think we're trying to find them.


15:01-15:02
I think we're trying to find them.


15:02-15:03
I think we're trying to find them.


15:03-15:04
I think we're trying to find them.


15:04-15:05
I think we're trying to find them.


15:05-15:06
I think we're trying to find them.


15:06-15:07
I think we're trying to find them.


15:07-15:08
I think we're trying to find them.


15:08-15:09
I think we're trying to find them.


15:09-15:10
I think we're trying to find them.


15:10-15:11
I think we're trying to find them.


15:11-15:12
I think we're trying to find them.


15:12-15:13
I think we're trying to find them.


15:13-15:14
I think we're trying to find them.


15:14-15:15
I think we're trying to find them.


15:15-15:16
I think we're trying to find them.


15:16-15:17
I think we're trying to find them.


15:17-15:18
I think we're trying to find them.


15:18-15:19
I think we're trying to find them.


15:19-15:20
I think we're trying to find them.


15:20-15:21
I think we're trying to find them.


15:21-15:24
I think we can identify some ideal people.


15:24-15:25
We can go outbound to.


15:25-15:30
I think last resort, I would say, is probably advertisement of this.


15:30-15:34
And I'm going to like scale because we'll just get well.


15:34-15:39
And we'll spend our time sifting through people that want 75 euros.


15:39-15:44
But I think let's work on that.


15:44-15:47
I think it's a good thing to do.


15:47-15:49
And I think it will definitely, definitely help.


15:49-15:54
But let's find thing that the key really has finding some really huge people


15:54-15:59
that will give us the best kind of feedback that we can actually action.


15:59-16:04
We do have seven or eight, nine people now who have responded to us directly.


16:04-16:06
I know you've talked about them once.


16:06-16:11
I'll follow up with a confirmation of the free year and then a direct thing saying,


16:11-16:13
we'll see how many then we get.


16:13-16:17
And I guess then see how many of our friends and family get through screening.


16:17-16:18
But maybe not family.


16:18-16:21
Before we need to go public.


16:21-16:31
Just something just about this approach, which it's the these are a lot of assumptions that we made in conversation.


16:31-16:44
And we need to be careful when asking the questions that we're not, you know, pulling the answers we want to hear, because we're sort of going in with a lot of assumptions
that are made mostly in a vacuum.


16:44-16:49
So we need to be really careful and really ask.


16:49-17:02
Be ready to accept different answers and be ready to ask kind of good, you know, questions that are not necessarily too leading in a way to sort of self fulfill our own
prophecy.


17:02-17:15
Yeah, that's exactly the concern that kind of led to this conversation with yours, as in what's the actual value of asking 10 people what they think of NodeScript if we
just want them to say a certain thing.


17:15-17:19
So we're not targeting people.


17:19-17:22
The first round was like, I knew developers.


17:22-17:24
So we just asked them, here's a tool.


17:24-17:25
What's your opinion?


17:25-17:29
This time that's kind of irrelevant because it's like, oh, this is good for these reasons.


17:29-17:49
We need someone who's either used it or used something similar or has a use case of it to say this is a specific anecdote as to why this is or isn't a good part of your
platform, I think.


17:49-17:50
So, I think that's a good question.


17:50-17:51
I think that's a good question.


17:51-17:52
I think that's a good question.


17:52-17:53
I think that's a good question.


17:53-17:54
I think that's a good question.

I think that's a good question.


19:49-19:50
I think that's a good question.


19:50-19:51
I think that's a good question.


19:51-19:52
I think that's a good question.


19:52-20:08
Okay, I'm looking forward to the results for it.


20:08-20:11
I put in the candle for tomorrow.


20:11-20:15
Norman, Adar, Marcus, something for us to have a strategic alignment.


20:15-20:21
I will be very good if the feedback from what we get shows happens to land perfectly alongside.


20:21-20:23
I agree as well.


20:23-20:30
So that would be a useful call and it's all coming along exactly the right time.


20:30-20:33
And with that, there's not much of an engineering thing today.


20:33-20:39
So I want to move over to the content outreach, what we're actually doing now as opposed to what we're doing next.


20:39-20:40
I'm sorry, Norman.


20:40-20:50
Yeah, so the idea is we want to find this content writer, technical writer.


20:50-21:02
So what we've done is we thought if we're going to pay people some money to test their ability, we thought we may as well get something out of it that we can use as well
potentially.


21:02-21:07
So we've got three people that we've done shortlisted that look pretty good.


21:07-21:14
And we have gone out to them with a task to kind of do what you did, Christelle.


21:14-21:21
So it's sign up for NodeScript, learn it, learn how to use it, build something, and then write about what they built.


21:21-21:22
You know, why did they build it?


21:22-21:23
What is it they built?


21:23-21:27
And what was the benefits of building it in NodeScript as opposed to some other platform?


21:27-21:29
They've all said they can do this.


21:29-21:30
They're up for it.


21:30-21:33
So the contracts are out and they should.


21:33-21:35
I imagine Dan will accept it today.


21:35-21:38
So they just went out recently.


21:38-21:40
So that's the plan.


21:40-21:43
It's pretty, it's not, it doesn't cost a lot of money to do it.


21:43-21:55
But the aim really here is to find someone that can, you know, fulfill our kind of technical content needs and outsourced.


21:55-21:57
Yeah, so that's all out.


21:57-21:58
Yeah.


21:58-21:59
Where is that?


21:59-22:00
I was going to put the contract.


22:00-22:01
I was just going to put it here.


22:01-22:02
The one you wrote.


22:02-22:03
Which channels?


22:03-22:04
Ah, there it is.


22:04-22:07
Yeah, so we got a pretty decent.


22:07-22:09
There's the text.


22:09-22:10
That's huge.


22:10-22:14
Basically, we asked them if they would be able to.


22:20-22:25
So we did a kind of screen on and checked with them before we asked them to do this contract that they could do it.


22:25-22:26
They would sign up.


22:26-22:27
They do all this stuff.


22:27-22:28
So.


22:28-22:32
Yeah, we've asked them to sign up, make a workflow, any integration, any kind of workflow.


22:32-22:33
It doesn't really matter what.


22:33-22:43
Build something, do something, make a cool thing, and then document it for us in around a thousand words, which is roughly what Christelle's examples were before.


22:43-22:47
And then we've offered them outreach if they need it.


22:47-22:48
They can just ask questions.


22:48-22:50
And six hours total.


22:50-22:53
From that we should get three usable pieces of content.


22:53-23:00
We'll use all of them and then we'll choose one of them, I think, to be the person for future stuff.


23:00-23:01
Yeah.


23:01-23:04
Any questions on that one?


23:04-23:06
Anything about this approach?


23:06-23:13
And then I just wanted an update on what's going on, Norman.


23:13-23:16
I know we put some money behind that little comparison thing.


23:16-23:17
A week to go.


23:17-23:18
How's it going?


23:18-23:22
Yeah, we did that run out for a week or so.


23:22-23:26
We didn't blow our socks off.


23:26-23:27
Nothing.


23:27-23:34
Nothing popped up and said it exactly came, the users came from that exactly.


23:34-23:40
But I imagine we got a few from it, but nothing that blew our socks off time.


23:40-23:47
So we have pared back the spend on content while we're a bit thin on the ground with it.


23:47-23:52
So yeah, nothing major to report on that.


23:52-23:57
It's just that we're kind of tracking as we have been, you know, with two or three signups a day.


23:57-24:01
We're spending, I think we're spending right now, £15 a day.


24:01-24:08
So it's kind of tracking up £7.50 a user, if not a little bit lower.


24:08-24:18
But yeah, there's nothing that's quite, I would say that we've definitely, you know, one point I think we were spending nearly £100 a day like a month ago.


24:18-24:20
Yeah, but now we've paid it back.


24:20-24:26
I think we're paying it back until we've got a bit more content that we can put in some money behind.


24:26-24:30
I think the content you did though, Dan, was fantastic.


24:30-24:35
The one that we got, we've got, I'd say we got hundreds of users from one piece of content that you did.


24:35-24:37
But I just think there was diminishing returns from it.


24:37-24:39
It definitely exhausted it.


24:39-24:48
And I didn't want to, you know, continue with that level of investment for something that was just, it wasn't bringing the £7.80 a day that it had in the past.


24:48-24:55
So I think it makes sense to pay it back until we get some more content we can put out.


24:55-24:59
Yeah, so we had 80 signups in January, which is about the middle of the road.


24:59-25:00
It's fine.


25:00-25:07
Yeah, the other content did get, to be fair, half a million views, which isn't bad.


25:07-25:08
Yeah.


25:08-25:10
The one only got like 10,000, so.


25:10-25:15
Yeah, and I think, and I do think we're tracking as we have, that we're still getting signups.


25:15-25:21
I'm convinced we're getting some organic signups or signups from the people coming across the


25:21-25:25
of the NodeScript channel and content without necessarily the money behind it.


25:25-25:30
So definitely, definitely trickling along with them, the signups.


25:30-25:41
And I think, and I think we, we've kind of proved, I think in the last few months that we've proved that we, if we do put a little bit of money behind some content and we, as
the right content, I think we will get signups from it.


25:41-25:49
I think we'll prove that so we know we can kind of switch the tab back on when we've got content.


25:49-25:50
Yep, I agree.


25:50-25:51
I absolutely agree.


25:51-25:55
And with this new stuff, we'll have a lot more different form of content too.


25:55-25:56
Okay, anything else?


25:56-26:01
Anything going on in the world of NodeScript across the board?


26:01-26:14
I've been, I asked a question in the NodeScript squad channel, but I think it's quite an important one, which is attaching metrics to endpoints.


26:14-26:25
And I think it's a little difficult at the moment because the way that the hooks work isn't, they don't really provide enough information to be able to add a hook.


26:25-26:31
So I guess it's a sort of feature request and also want to sort of know what everyone else thinks about this.


26:31-26:41
So the way that they're currently set up is the after hook cannot see the endpoint response.


26:41-26:44
It can only see the body.


26:44-26:47
So I can't see the headers or anything like this.


26:47-26:54
And also, as I mentioned, I'm going to go ahead and see the body.


26:54-26:59
As I understand it, either invokes an after hook or an error handler.


26:59-27:05
Whereas for metrics, you kind of want it to be after the error handler or after everything.


27:05-27:08
Maybe we almost need a separate metrics hook.


27:08-27:18
And then it should also, well, I guess if you can get it from the response headers, you can get things like latency and status codes and all that good stuff.


27:18-27:20
So maybe that's kind of handled.


27:20-27:21
So, yeah.


27:21-27:22
Any thoughts?


27:22-27:30
I agree that it needs, you mentioned around first documentation, right?


27:30-27:36
That was one of the comments, but also, yes, this, not being able to actually get the response.


27:36-27:48
And yeah, I think it could use a lot of improvements on the how to use side, but also this kind of connectivity between the hooks and the actual endpoint that you're
calling.


27:48-27:49
So, yeah.


27:49-28:01
Of course, it's an advanced use case, but it's something that I also see in the comments from vertical node script channel, like from Daniel, Alex as well.


28:01-28:06
Yeah, because we're building metrics on all of our main services, obviously.


28:06-28:11
And I think we're kind of doing it sort of different way in each time.


28:11-28:14
And sometimes we're doing it with hooks and other times we're doing it inside the endpoints.


28:14-28:16
Inside the endpoints is not really ideal.


28:16-28:19
Yeah, because you can't reuse it, right?


28:19-28:25
Like, I think you just want one quick career and find when you pass the stuff that you need to.


28:25-28:26
Yeah.


28:26-28:27
Yeah, yeah, exactly.


28:27-28:32
And in general, I would say the hooks stuff is very basic and difficult to test.


28:32-28:41
I mean, there isn't really any way of testing it other than just putting it on, kind of hoping that it works and then testing the endpoint and seeing if it does what you
want.


28:41-28:54
So it's probably I mean, again, it's an advanced use case, but it's important and it's something we need to think about and at least provide some documentation because
there's no docs for hooks at all.


28:54-28:58
Yeah, that one is easy to get off the get started on.


28:58-29:04
Yeah, the other stuff needs to probably need to talk as a team, like how the two guys solve this.


29:04-29:15
Like the usability, they mentioned we could maybe look into having like more granular stats, just like you have the endpoints little stats, right?


29:15-29:20
You know, your endpoint is running, but you don't see that for the actual hooks themselves.


29:20-29:23
So, yeah.


29:23-29:24
Yeah, yeah.


29:24-29:29
The other thing is the way that the metrics are done at the moment, and I can't get why it's with sampling.


29:29-29:33
So you're only getting a certain number of them for some endpoints.


29:33-29:38
We just want everything always because we would actually want to use them for metrics.


29:38-29:49
So there is a question as to whether maybe you could just edit that, edit a setting on the endpoint and say, I don't want to do sampling.


29:49-29:53
I want to save all the all the logs.


29:53-29:58
And then maybe you kind of get that whole feature for free because I'm basically just rebuilding what we have there.


29:58-29:59
But in.


29:59-30:00
BigQuery.


30:00-30:01
BigQuery.


30:01-30:07
And then selecting some of the some of the fields that I'm interested in and not others.


30:07-30:08
I don't know.


30:08-30:10
Anyway, it's it's kind of food for thought really.


30:10-30:12
It's ticketed for a discussion.


30:12-30:13
We'll see how it goes.


30:13-30:17
And update documentation as well.


30:17-30:22
I think I might start a collection ticket for things that we know are missing to add things documentation.


30:22-30:23
It's one of two things now.


30:23-30:27
Anything else today?


30:27-30:32
All right, then we're done today.


30:32-30:33
Quite a short one.


30:33-30:36
And we have this thing in the calendar for tomorrow.


30:36-30:40
And it should kind of all coincide with Shores' updates and stuff next week.


30:40-30:41
So that's good.


30:41-30:46
Shores, just can you just write what you need from us as a collective in terms of if you want


30:46-30:48
to suggest anyone if you want.


30:48-30:53
And then you ask for feedback on like what and who we should be talking to about what.


30:53-30:57
And just put all of that in the channel if it comes to mind.


30:57-31:01
All right.


31:01-31:04
Okay, then take a half hour back everyone.


31:04-31:05
Have a great day.


31:05-31:06
Cool.


31:06-31:07
Thanks all.


31:07-31:08
Thanks, Dan.


31:08-31:09
Thanks, Bob.


31:09-31:39
Thank you.
