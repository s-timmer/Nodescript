Microphone: 
00:00-00:29
Thank you.

System Audio: 
00:00-00:05
and then you know and that maybe we can interview them a little bit better or if it's if we just find

System Audio: 
00:05-00:10
people and reach out to them do it that way what's the general thought when you say post an ad where

System Audio: 
00:10-00:17
are you thinking of posting the ads on um work up work yeah we just post something and let them come

System Audio: 
00:17-00:24
to us i'm leaning towards that a little bit more probably a little bit more work because we have to

System Audio: 
00:24-00:33
a write the ad and then we have to manage the you know sorts but but probably better probably better

Microphone: 
00:29-00:33
Yeah.

System Audio: 
00:33-00:35
because we get full control over it now

Microphone: 
00:33-00:39
It would be an interesting experiment, like just see what we get back.

System Audio: 
00:35-00:53
yeah

Microphone: 
00:39-00:43
And I guess there's always the option to reach out to people individually afterwards.

Microphone: 
00:43-00:50
Because I think the downside of an ad might be we get 400 reactions and okay, fuck, now

Microphone: 
00:50-00:51
we're swamped.

Microphone: 
00:51-00:53
But let's see.

System Audio: 
00:53-00:56
yeah that's unfortunately

System Audio: 
00:56-01:10
and i think the whole having to write an ad although it is work it might help us as well understand you

Microphone: 
00:56-01:02
But even if that happens, okay, this method is not working and we haven't lost that much

Microphone: 
01:02-01:04
effort in putting out this ad.

Microphone: 
01:04-01:05
Okay.

System Audio: 
01:10-01:15
know exactly what war might make us think about exactly what we need so i think i don't think that's

Microphone: 
01:11-01:18
Thank you.

System Audio: 
01:15-01:21
a fair enough idea that i was good with that i think we should before i think one thing we should

Microphone: 
01:18-01:26
Thank you.

System Audio: 
01:21-01:27
do this morning is let's just talk around like what's the objective of these getting these people

Microphone: 
01:26-01:28
Thank you.

System Audio: 
01:27-01:33
in you know what we put content we really need let's just try to get us all on the same page so

Microphone: 
01:28-01:35
Thank you.

System Audio: 
01:33-01:38
yeah we know what we're after but yeah i think that's good idea so let's do this one once we're

Microphone: 
01:35-01:37
Thank you.

Microphone: 
01:37-01:41
Thank you.

System Audio: 
01:38-01:46
talking it through i will in the background make an upwork account yeah so there you go sorry

Microphone: 
01:41-01:43
Thank you.

Microphone: 
01:43-01:45
Thank you.

Microphone: 
01:45-01:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
01:46-01:50
otherwise we'll talk about it and then okay great and then i'll go make a coffee and then it'll be like

Microphone: 
01:47-02:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
01:50-01:55
wait what was i supposed to do so i'm going to make the account now yeah yeah so maybe just for your benefit

System Audio: 
01:55-02:01
joel because i know you're coming you've been you're quite new to this the the idea and you might

System Audio: 
02:01-02:08
know this but the idea is that you know the user acquisition for node script very much content led

System Audio: 
02:08-02:14
you know a lot of content dan has pretty much done all the content and date we need more content and and

System Audio: 
02:14-02:24
we can't duplicate dan and so we think it is we instead of like hiring somebody like hiring an actual team

Microphone: 
02:17-02:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
02:24-02:30
member we try to outsource this and find somebody that can do it but a good standard not not like a

System Audio: 
02:30-02:37
cheapo five hour pay 20 pound and get 50 blogs so we know we're going to have to pay a bit more for

System Audio: 
02:37-02:45
somebody that's actually genuinely good the idea is we get someone in that can do what we need we might

System Audio: 
02:45-02:50
learn along the way what we actually really need as they're doing it and we can change it a bit and then

Microphone: 
02:47-03:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
02:50-02:57
the idea would be that we could potentially bring this in house and the second half of the year if we

System Audio: 
02:57-03:03
if it is working and all everything kind of falls into place we could maybe bring it in house but that's

System Audio: 
03:03-03:10
the idea and that's right isn't it dan george i'm writing that yeah it's just technical writing busy

System Audio: 
03:10-03:18
busy busy stuff and this i've agreed with boris at boris request actually um that this person we bring

Microphone: 
03:17-03:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
03:18-03:23
in will do a lot of technical writing not so much like you know video stuff we want them to write long

System Audio: 
03:23-03:31
form how to's and stuff uh to basically show like the concepts of automation if you're using node script

System Audio: 
03:31-03:35
so like we discussed yesterday in the meeting we want a content writer who fits that gap to people

System Audio: 
03:35-03:40
who says okay you know how to automate this is how you do those things with node script that's what we want

System Audio: 
03:41-03:52
so do you think they will do any stuff that we could that would duplicate some of the stuff you have done

Microphone: 
03:47-04:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
03:52-03:56
or do you think this would just free you up to do more of that stuff what's your thing

System Audio: 
03:56-04:06
yeah um i think no i think they will do we'll still post all all that stuff will still be marketable

System Audio: 
04:06-04:11
just to be able to put it out as like look at our latest content it'd be good for linkedin it'd be good

System Audio: 
04:11-04:18
for part of that i think the actual content in terms of like uh person in front of camera i'm still i

Microphone: 
04:17-04:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
04:18-04:24
still be able to do those things yeah um yeah which is good because we i don't think i think it's

System Audio: 
04:24-04:29
harder to find someone who's able to do the technical writing or so quite you know be able to edit and be

System Audio: 
04:29-04:39
in front of the camera um so it's easier for us yeah that makes sense what we're missing is this technical thing

System Audio: 
04:39-05:09
Thank you.

Microphone: 
04:47-05:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
05:09-05:39
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:17-05:19
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:19-05:21
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:21-05:23
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:23-05:25
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:25-05:27
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:27-05:29
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:29-05:31
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:31-05:31
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:31-05:33
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:33-05:35
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:35-05:37
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:37-05:39
Thank you.

System Audio: 
05:39-05:41
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:39-05:43
Thank you.

System Audio: 
05:41-05:46
Yeah, that's it.

Microphone: 
05:43-05:45
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:45-05:45
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:45-05:45
Thank you.

Microphone: 
05:45-05:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
05:46-05:53
I think it'd be interesting to see if they like see...

Microphone: 
05:47-06:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
05:53-05:57
This would be actually very interesting for us now to think about it because we'll give

System Audio: 
05:57-06:00
someone that, oh, we know you have technical knowledge.

System Audio: 
06:00-06:01
We're paying you.

System Audio: 
06:01-06:03
Can you use NodeScript?

System Audio: 
06:03-06:05
Hopefully they'll go, yeah, this is great.

System Audio: 
06:05-06:06
I get it.

System Audio: 
06:06-06:07
I totally get it.

System Audio: 
06:07-06:12
If they don't do that, then we have a problem because we'll be like, right, it's us, not them.

System Audio: 
06:12-06:13
That would be...

System Audio: 
06:13-06:15
This is a really interesting fact, I think.

System Audio: 
06:15-06:17
Yeah, but then we're looking for...

System Audio: 
06:17-06:22
What we said yesterday was, you don't need to be a great developer to use NodeScript, but

Microphone: 
06:17-06:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
06:22-06:25
you need to understand the development concepts to use NodeScript.

System Audio: 
06:25-06:26
Yeah.

System Audio: 
06:26-06:30
So we're looking for somebody who would potentially...

System Audio: 
06:30-06:35
Are you guys thinking that they've got some background in development?

System Audio: 
06:35-06:37
Because that sounds like...

System Audio: 
06:37-06:38
It's special.

System Audio: 
06:38-06:39
They have to have some...

System Audio: 
06:39-06:40
Yeah.

System Audio: 
06:40-06:44
But they're not spending their time developing.

System Audio: 
06:44-06:48
They're spending their time writing.

Microphone: 
06:47-07:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
06:48-06:49
Yeah.

System Audio: 
06:49-06:50
Yeah.

System Audio: 
06:50-06:52
Well, that's a good point.

System Audio: 
06:52-06:57
But then the good argument is that you can, if they're passionate about it, they'll write

System Audio: 
06:57-06:58
about it, I suppose, quite easily.

System Audio: 
06:58-07:03
A good question to add in here is, are we expecting them to come up with their own content,

System Audio: 
07:03-07:09
or are we going to feed them stuff that we want to be posted?

System Audio: 
07:09-07:15
I can ask, for example, I know Boris wanted a bunch of very specific things, so maybe a

System Audio: 
07:15-07:16
mix of both now and...

System Audio: 
07:16-07:17
Yeah.

System Audio: 
07:17-07:19
I think, yeah, I think we can guide them, but I think we need...

Microphone: 
07:17-07:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
07:19-07:22
I think if we're going to hire somebody, we're going to pay them a good, good, good wage.

System Audio: 
07:22-07:25
It's not, it's not a $5 for all this work.

System Audio: 
07:25-07:26
It's a good wage.

System Audio: 
07:26-07:31
I think we need them to be able to be, you know, self starting on some of the content and

System Audio: 
07:31-07:35
coming up with ideas that we maybe have a, you know, they maybe not have total autonomy

System Audio: 
07:35-07:38
to have an idea and go and make it happen, but they maybe bring some ideas to the

System Audio: 
07:38-07:39
to the team.

System Audio: 
07:39-07:40
Yeah.

System Audio: 
07:40-07:50
But, so what I was going to say, so in terms of what we actually need them for at a higher

Microphone: 
07:47-08:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
07:50-07:57
level, are we saying what they will do will help us attract more users, so user acquisition

System Audio: 
07:57-08:04
stuff, but are you thinking, yes and no, that we are also wanting them, the content they write

System Audio: 
08:04-08:11
are they going to help with activation of users and that progression to paid?

System Audio: 
08:11-08:16
Not directly how you're, I think phrasing it, or how you're thinking.

System Audio: 
08:16-08:23
I think a good byproduct of this will become that, because we'll have a presence now in, however you

Microphone: 
08:17-08:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
08:23-08:35
choose to post all those content forums or just articles that we then share through Reddit and stuff, a byproduct of that will become people who, like the ultra nerds
who sit and read this long-frame content will then, yeah.

System Audio: 
08:35-08:42
I don't think it will be like the traditional, like they won't be writing, come try Nodescript.

System Audio: 
08:42-08:48
What they'll do is like, how did I set up a Pegasus server using an automation platform?

Microphone: 
08:47-09:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
08:48-08:54
And people will answer, okay, how do you do that? And then a byproduct of that will be, what's this thing Nodescript you're using?

System Audio: 
08:54-08:57
It's kind of what I think would be more.

System Audio: 
08:57-09:06
They'll also write a lot more of our stuff. For example, if you want to teach Nodescript, you need to teach the fundamentals of automation, which is difficult.

System Audio: 
09:06-09:15
They can write that for us. That's a difficult long-form thing to do if they're really good and we give them budget, they can write that kind of stuff for us.

System Audio: 
09:15-09:16
You know.

System Audio: 
09:16-09:35
Okay, yeah, absolutely. So, them writing, I'm just trying to think of the ultimate deliverables that will help us get to. If they're writing long-form content on the
kind of principles of automation, how to do automation better, what does that deliver?

Microphone: 
09:17-09:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
09:35-09:47
Yeah. So, like, okay. So, yeah. It will say something along the lines of, okay, do you need to figure out, do you need to quickly set up and deploy backend automations for
your customers?

System Audio: 
09:47-09:56
Because you are a freelance engineer, for example. So, you're having a coffee and you scroll through and go, "Aha." And you click it and it's like, "This is how I do it
with this thing called Nodescript. It's super easy."

Microphone: 
09:47-10:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
09:56-10:05
So, then that's how you get turned on to Nodescript. So, ultimately, it's paid users as a direct result of this content.

System Audio: 
10:05-10:32
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I get it. And that, but that's also just new users as well. I think that is like that. I think that the stuff they'll write will help us with
signups, new user acquisition, and it might help towards activation. If they're coming with a bit more understanding of what we do or a specific use case or all this,
all this stuff that might help them get on board. Do you think, do you think some of the content they'll write will be about onboarding?

Microphone: 
10:17-10:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
10:32-10:38
actual onboarding or getting better at using it and all that stuff?

System Audio: 
10:38-10:43
I think there's two things in my head. I want them also to do a lot of work towards our documentation.

System Audio: 
10:43-10:44
Mm-hmm.

System Audio: 
10:44-10:55
How to set up, like, the generalized way to how to set up an automated backend server using Nodescript. And then that will be like the go-to documentation we use for it.

Microphone: 
10:47-11:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
10:55-11:07
Also, I want them to write, here is an example of how I built this complicated thing, which is like a, like a, I don't know how you describe it, more like a hobby article,
you know?

System Audio: 
11:07-11:07
Mm-hmm.

System Audio: 
11:07-11:16
Pull people on. And frankly, it's because I don't have the technical knowledge to write it because I don't, I know how to do it in Nodescript, but I couldn't write it.

System Audio: 
11:16-11:18
And Boris doesn't have the time, so.

Microphone: 
11:17-11:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
11:18-11:20
That's what they would.

System Audio: 
11:20-11:22
Yep.

System Audio: 
11:22-11:37
Yeah.

System Audio: 
11:37-11:49
Yeah.

Microphone: 
11:47-12:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
11:49-11:56
Mm-hmm.

System Audio: 
11:56-12:02
Mm-hmm.

System Audio: 
12:02-12:06
Okay.

System Audio: 
12:06-12:27
Yeah.

Microphone: 
12:17-12:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
12:27-12:34
Yeah.

System Audio: 
12:34-12:36
Yeah.

System Audio: 
12:36-12:51
Yeah.

Microphone: 
12:47-13:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
12:51-13:04
Yeah.

System Audio: 
13:04-13:05
Yeah.

System Audio: 
13:05-13:06
And that makes sense.

System Audio: 
13:06-13:14
And in terms of the -- so I think that's cool that the content we'll be writing will help us with all across the user funnel.

System Audio: 
13:14-13:22
And in terms of the actual -- the really -- the nice videos we've done, Dan, with the -- that's got us all the leads.

Microphone: 
13:17-13:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
13:22-13:31
I mean, Joe, for your benefit, because it was before you were here, pretty much all of the users we have got on Node Scripts have come from --

System Audio: 
13:31-13:43
Well, either they add the -- that George did on Reddit, or probably the vast majority of the users all came before Reddit was switched on from Dan's --

System Audio: 
13:43-13:50
a few videos, basically the four videos that Dan has done, and we put some money behind it, and they resonated.

Microphone: 
13:47-14:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
13:50-13:51
Yeah.

System Audio: 
13:51-14:04
So in terms of this new person coming in, or this was person, not persons over time, there are lots of content, but we will try and turn some of those ideas into videos or
short-form content that we can push out.

System Audio: 
14:04-14:05
You're thinking, Dan?

System Audio: 
14:05-14:07
Yeah, exactly.

System Audio: 
14:07-14:14
I have a whole bunch of ideas already for this stuff, but when this stuff comes in, we will turn them into videos to some extent, yeah.

System Audio: 
14:14-14:15
Okay.

System Audio: 
14:15-14:24
You know, even if it's just like a -- even if we go, like, full into the sort of marketing click-baity world of, like, check out our article here, you know?

Microphone: 
14:17-14:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
14:24-14:25
Okay, and that's easy.

System Audio: 
14:25-14:26
Yeah.

System Audio: 
14:26-14:28
Easy, easy me.

System Audio: 
14:28-14:37
In terms of, like, something you said, George, Marcus's idea, it was the go-to-market strategy of Zapier and all these other,

System Audio: 
14:37-14:47
where they basically used use cases as SEO stuff, and so whatever you type into Google, Zapier would appear because you want to do Google and Slack, whatever.

System Audio: 
14:47-15:01
If we were -- and we've not tried any of that -- if we were going to try and do that, we would need a -- we'd probably need an SEO hire, like Tom or somebody, Joe, to come in and
help us do it.

Microphone: 
14:47-15:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
15:01-15:02
Yeah.

System Audio: 
15:02-15:06
I don't know how -- I don't know if SEO is the right way forward just now.

System Audio: 
15:06-15:10
I think we could maybe just --

System Audio: 
15:10-15:14
You'll naturally get some from these articles going up.

System Audio: 
15:14-15:17
It just might not necessarily be the kind of core things.

Microphone: 
15:17-15:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
15:17-15:20
Yeah, and it might not be as optimized.

System Audio: 
15:20-15:21
Yeah.

System Audio: 
15:21-15:33
But if we know kind of what -- if we've got a rough idea of what keywords are that we kind of want to hit, then we can kind of give that to the content writing and go, like,
these are your kind of core things.

System Audio: 
15:33-15:36
But they should naturally be going into the articles anyway.

System Audio: 
15:36-15:48
Yeah, we could do a little bit of that, and then just -- we could just suck it and see in if we needed -- if we thought there might be a bigger benefit in SEO for this, we could
get someone in later.

Microphone: 
15:47-16:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
15:48-15:50
I know, getting them in later and then rebuilding it.

System Audio: 
15:50-15:55
But it feels like if we -- we don't even know what to invest 20 grand in SEO just now.

System Audio: 
15:55-15:58
I'm just thinking -- I'm thinking out loud, folks.

System Audio: 
15:58-16:01
I don't -- I'm thinking we probably don't try an SEO at first.

System Audio: 
16:01-16:02
We probably just --

System Audio: 
16:02-16:05
It feels like next steps, doesn't it?

System Audio: 
16:05-16:06
Yeah, that's right.

System Audio: 
16:06-16:11
So maybe just we'll do the content, write the content, and then we'll have a better think about SEO, Joe, because that might be --

System Audio: 
16:11-16:12
Yeah.

System Audio: 
16:12-16:18
That might be -- that might be -- that might be a good way to get users -- if we're writing not a huge amount of content.

Microphone: 
16:17-16:47
Thank you.

System Audio: 
16:18-16:23
Because that's always the stumbling block where they say, "Oh, you've got to write a huge amount of content."

System Audio: 
16:23-16:26
That's the effort side.

System Audio: 
16:26-16:27
Okay.

System Audio: 
16:27-16:28
Off a tangent.

System Audio: 
16:28-16:32
So who are you thinking would -- who will manage this?

System Audio: 
16:32-16:33
Yeah.

System Audio: 
16:33-16:34
Well, that's actually my next question.

System Audio: 
16:34-16:40
I would just -- as I'm signing up, I probably should put this under a shared email so we can all access the account.

System Audio: 
16:40-16:41
Yep.

System Audio: 
16:41-16:45
So I probably should do it under accounts at you.

System Audio: 
16:45-16:46
I don't know what accounts.

System Audio: 
16:46-16:50
I just saw -- was it yourself, Shorj, who was asking yesterday?

Microphone: 
16:47-17:17
Thank you.

System Audio: 
16:50-16:51
Who was asking yesterday?

System Audio: 
16:51-16:57
I was asking because I wanted to do it for accounts at NodeScript.

System Audio: 
16:57-16:58
But --

System Audio: 
16:58-16:59
It doesn't exist, does it?

System Audio: 
16:59-17:01
No, it doesn't -- because it's usually for finance, right?

System Audio: 
17:01-17:02
So --

System Audio: 
17:02-17:03
Yeah.

System Audio: 
17:03-17:04
So --

System Audio: 
17:04-17:05
Yeah.

System Audio: 
17:05-17:09
Well, I forgot -- I think it was at Christelle was posting about it.

System Audio: 
17:09-17:10
I forgot.

System Audio: 
17:10-17:15
Got hello.

System Audio: 
17:15-17:18
Hello, as long as we all have access to it.

Microphone: 
17:17-17:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
17:18-17:19
Let me just see.

System Audio: 
17:19-17:21
Can anybody see that list?

System Audio: 
17:21-17:22
There was a list yesterday.

System Audio: 
17:22-17:23
I'm just trying to find it.

System Audio: 
17:23-17:26
Somebody said, I think it was Christelle.

System Audio: 
17:26-17:27
Yes, so this is Christelle.

System Audio: 
17:27-17:33
At the moment we have access to hello, support, but nothing similar to accounts.

System Audio: 
17:33-17:34
So --

System Audio: 
17:34-17:35
Okay, we can use hello.

System Audio: 
17:35-17:38
It's just for us to log in.

System Audio: 
17:38-17:39
Well, is that a problem?

System Audio: 
17:39-17:39
I'm pretty sure it's fine.

System Audio: 
17:39-17:40
Logs changer.

System Audio: 
17:40-17:41
Yeah.

System Audio: 
17:41-17:42
All right.

System Audio: 
17:42-17:43
Let's make a password.

System Audio: 
17:43-17:45
And I'll put it into one pass.

System Audio: 
17:45-17:46
I'll put it into one pass.

System Audio: 
17:46-17:46
I'll put it all into one pass for us.

System Audio: 
17:46-17:46
I'll put it all into one pass for us.

System Audio: 
17:46-17:47
Oh, no.

Microphone: 
17:46-18:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
17:47-17:48
I'm pretty sure it's fine.

System Audio: 
17:48-17:49
I'm pretty sure it's fine.

System Audio: 
17:49-17:50
Logs changer.

System Audio: 
17:50-17:51
Yeah.

System Audio: 
17:51-17:52
All right.

System Audio: 
17:52-17:53
Let's make a password.

System Audio: 
17:53-17:54
Let's make a password.

System Audio: 
17:54-18:00
And I'll put it into one pass.

System Audio: 
18:00-18:01
Oh, yeah.

System Audio: 
18:01-18:01
Yeah.

System Audio: 
18:01-18:02
That's a bad password.

System Audio: 
18:02-18:03
There you go.

System Audio: 
18:03-18:04
That's going to be our password.

System Audio: 
18:04-18:05
I'll put it all into one pass for us.

System Audio: 
18:05-18:07
I'll put it here so I don't lose it.

System Audio: 
18:07-18:08
Oh, yeah.

System Audio: 
18:09-18:17
There you go, that's gonna be our password. I'll put it all into one pass for us, I'll put it here so I don't lose it.

Microphone: 
18:16-18:46
And is it.

System Audio: 
18:17-18:27
Oh yeah, that's a good shout out. It knows scripted up there isn't it.

System Audio: 
18:27-18:34
Yeah.

System Audio: 
18:34-18:53
Okay, so...

Microphone: 
18:46-19:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
18:53-19:04
Yeah.

System Audio: 
19:04-19:15
Okay, so that's it. That's the credentials. We can all just, let's just check everyone can log in to it I guess.

System Audio: 
19:15-19:20
They're the credentials.

Microphone: 
19:16-19:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
19:20-19:31
We will need some, so in terms of, we will need a billing method to hire, so it sounds like I will need to just speak to Brad.

System Audio: 
19:31-19:35
So I'll do this, I'll speak to Brad/Mel and I'll get us a card for that.

System Audio: 
19:35-19:44
So do we pay these people through Upwork? So Upwork take their 10% or something like that, so it works, I'll take it.

System Audio: 
19:44-19:48
I have absolutely no idea. This is totally new territory for me.

Microphone: 
19:46-20:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
19:48-19:59
I'll speak to Brad and we'll just say just now we just need a card to allow us to do the process. We're not going to spend any money yet. I'll do that just after this call so
that we can put our card down.

System Audio: 
19:59-20:00
Okay, the...

System Audio: 
20:00-20:01
Okay, the...

System Audio: 
20:01-20:02
I'll verify it.

System Audio: 
20:02-20:06
Can I make it mine just so I can verify it right now?

System Audio: 
20:06-20:07
Yeah.

System Audio: 
20:07-20:11
Yeah, no, I mean it looks like you kind of pay through that, from what I understand.

System Audio: 
20:11-20:12
You pay through it. Okay.

System Audio: 
20:12-20:13
Yeah.

System Audio: 
20:13-20:23
And so what I'll do is touch base with Boris and stuff and find out exactly what content he's expecting.

Microphone: 
20:16-20:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
20:23-20:24
Okay.

System Audio: 
20:24-20:34
And then get a list together of things we actually want. So then still on the list of things is that we need to actually write the advert and post it.

System Audio: 
20:34-20:41
Yeah, yeah. And they'll definitely, I'm sure they'll ask in here what skills are required for the Upworker.

System Audio: 
20:41-20:52
So I think we are saying, obviously they're going to have writing skills and all that stuff, but I'm sure they'll get AI in here to help us define the skills.

Microphone: 
20:46-21:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
20:52-20:58
But I do think we'll need to have somebody that's got some, you said, development understanding.

System Audio: 
20:58-21:01
So we can figure that out.

System Audio: 
21:01-21:10
Then how do we see it? So say we get this person, right? They seem fine.

System Audio: 
21:10-21:13
They're doing two and a half days a week. So yeah, we talked about before.

System Audio: 
21:13-21:21
And we get them in. How are we going to manage them day to day?

Microphone: 
21:16-21:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
21:21-21:23
I think how are we going to do it?

System Audio: 
21:23-21:29
That's a good question. Why don't we...

System Audio: 
21:29-21:34
We don't need to know this now about this. I'll just ask.

System Audio: 
21:34-21:39
No, we can, if we all have shared access to this account, we could just, we should just do a weekly check-in.

System Audio: 
21:39-21:42
That's the four of us. We could just keep this, it's a short-term project.

System Audio: 
21:42-21:47
So let's just do the four of us meet up and say, look, this is the content we're giving them now.

Microphone: 
21:46-22:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
21:47-21:53
And then next time we meet, let's review it together. And then we can also use this time to distribute how it gets marketed.

System Audio: 
21:53-21:59
Well, if I go make a video about it alongside, if you guys want to post a LinkedIn thing about it on one side,

System Audio: 
21:59-22:03
we can just put this in the calendar for, let's just say the coming quarter.

System Audio: 
22:03-22:13
A good excuse for the four of us. And if we do it on, I would rather do it at the beginning of the week so that we can update on the Wednesday meeting.

System Audio: 
22:13-22:15
Does that sound smarter?

System Audio: 
22:15-22:20
Yeah, that's fine for me, I think. Yeah. And if we don't, if we didn't, we can do it the next...

Microphone: 
22:16-22:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
22:20-22:26
It's just, if we don't say, say we do on Friday, then every time we get to the next weekly Wednesday meeting, we'll be like,

System Audio: 
22:26-22:29
we did something last week, which I can't remember now.

System Audio: 
22:29-22:30
Yeah.

System Audio: 
22:30-22:31
Okay.

System Audio: 
22:31-22:32
That's fine.

System Audio: 
22:32-22:41
Your client, I mean, marketplace feel increased to 8%.

System Audio: 
22:41-22:46
So they take 8%.

System Audio: 
22:46-22:51
They take, okay. Interesting.

Microphone: 
22:46-23:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
22:51-23:01
What did we say then? I've got this written down somewhere, we've got this to...

System Audio: 
23:01-23:04
Oh yeah, that was it, it was like 30 to 50, wasn't it?

System Audio: 
23:04-23:08
Yeah, I'll dig it out. Let's see.

System Audio: 
23:08-23:12
I would go higher if we can, because we want quality.

System Audio: 
23:12-23:19
We do, and I think we'll just fail if we get cheap.

Microphone: 
23:16-23:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
23:19-23:20
Okay.

System Audio: 
23:20-23:27
This is an interesting leap. Interesting how it leaps here if you're paying in the middle, you know.

System Audio: 
23:27-23:37
50 to 55, well, is that...

System Audio: 
23:37-23:40
You tell me, we wrote it down, so we already did this.

System Audio: 
23:40-23:41
Yeah, we said...

System Audio: 
23:41-23:45
It's a different document, we have to do some maths.

System Audio: 
23:45-23:46
We said...

System Audio: 
23:46-23:51
10K would give us...

Microphone: 
23:46-24:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
23:51-23:56
10,000 pounds would give us 2 and a half hours a week for 12 weeks.

System Audio: 
23:56-23:59
So that's 12 times 2.5, so...

System Audio: 
23:59-24:05
10,000 hours a week for 2 hours is 30 hours.

System Audio: 
24:05-24:07
30 hours a week, yeah.

System Audio: 
24:07-24:10
But what we could do is, frankly, for one article...

System Audio: 
24:10-24:12
10,000 pounds a week.

System Audio: 
24:12-24:18
To be honest, one article, two articles a month would be way better than we have now.

Microphone: 
24:16-24:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
24:18-24:23
So we can pay more and get less and still be way ahead of where we are, so I'm happy to do it like that.

System Audio: 
24:23-24:31
If we do 50 hours and they give us an article every three weeks, as long as it's a good article, then that's very nice content for what we're doing.

System Audio: 
24:31-24:37
We also don't want to fall into the trap of overexposure here, because we're still doing other things.

System Audio: 
24:37-24:41
We don't know how it's going to scale.

System Audio: 
24:41-24:43
So perhaps it's better.

System Audio: 
24:43-24:45
We do 50 to 55 now.

System Audio: 
24:45-24:51
We'll do the maths on it afterwards, and if that just means one article a fortnight or once every three weeks, that's okay.

Microphone: 
24:46-25:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
24:51-24:55
Because it gives me time to make the videos still okay.

System Audio: 
24:55-24:56
Okay.

System Audio: 
24:56-24:57
Okay.

System Audio: 
24:57-25:01
Just quickly on the numbers, we said 10 grand for 240 hours.

System Audio: 
25:01-25:02
Yeah.

System Audio: 
25:02-25:07
So £10,000 divided by 240 hours is £41.66.

System Audio: 
25:07-25:08
So yeah, £41.66 to USD.

System Audio: 
25:08-25:22
It would be, I started wrong, USD.

Microphone: 
25:16-25:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
25:22-25:24
50, $51.

System Audio: 
25:24-25:28
So that's fine, that's 50, $55.

System Audio: 
25:28-25:29
That's fine.

System Audio: 
25:29-25:30
So that's fine.

System Audio: 
25:30-25:39
Oh, this is an interesting, we can do fixed price if you want to do it that way.

System Audio: 
25:39-25:44
And we tell them, look, we want you to come on board for three months and we'll pay you £10,000.

System Audio: 
25:44-25:47
That's a very intuitive offer.

Microphone: 
25:46-26:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
25:47-25:49
Yeah, fixed price is fine.

System Audio: 
25:49-25:54
I think once we know what we're getting and what we've got to spend, I think we'll have to do that for now.

System Audio: 
25:54-25:57
Yeah, hourly rate for now then, that's fine.

System Audio: 
25:57-25:59
All right, move forward with this.

System Audio: 
25:59-26:01
Oh, that means AI.

System Audio: 
26:01-26:05
I don't know, if a circle spins, it usually means something.

System Audio: 
26:05-26:06
Okay.

System Audio: 
26:06-26:12
There you go, look at this, that's pretty good.

System Audio: 
26:12-26:33
All right, so I just want to maybe...

Microphone: 
26:16-26:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
26:33-26:34
It's pretty good.

System Audio: 
26:34-26:35
This is great.

System Audio: 
26:35-26:36
Not bad.

System Audio: 
26:36-26:37
Not bad for...

System Audio: 
26:37-26:38
For the robot.

System Audio: 
26:38-26:53
Scope one to three months, intermediate level, 50 to 50 an hour.

Microphone: 
26:46-27:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
26:53-26:55
This is perfect, actually, I'm really happy.

System Audio: 
26:55-26:56
Screenshots.

System Audio: 
26:56-26:58
We could put some screenshots.

System Audio: 
26:58-27:01
What do you think intermediate level is?

System Audio: 
27:01-27:07
Not good enough to be Boris, but better than me.

System Audio: 
27:07-27:11
That's somewhere in that category, right?

System Audio: 
27:11-27:12
I'd say.

System Audio: 
27:12-27:16
Not good enough to be building it by yourself, but good enough to understand it.

System Audio: 
27:16-27:20
So what does the scope mean?

Microphone: 
27:16-27:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
27:20-27:23
So it says medium, one to three months obviously makes sense.

System Audio: 
27:23-27:25
And to make some medium, what does medium mean?

System Audio: 
27:25-27:28
If I edit it, that might give it a bit more insight.

System Audio: 
27:28-27:29
Yeah.

System Audio: 
27:29-27:32
It did not.

System Audio: 
27:32-27:37
So medium, well-defined projects, research and writing ebooks, okay.

System Audio: 
27:37-27:40
Okay, here we go, okay.

System Audio: 
27:40-27:41
Longer term.

System Audio: 
27:41-27:42
Yeah, medium.

System Audio: 
27:42-27:43
Yeah, medium.

System Audio: 
27:43-27:44
I think medium's right.

System Audio: 
27:44-27:46
Yeah, we're not asking them to create the strategy or...

System Audio: 
27:46-27:49
We're going to do what we tell, if that makes sense.

Microphone: 
27:46-28:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
27:49-27:50
Well, I think one to three months is fine.

System Audio: 
27:50-27:54
I think that makes sense.

System Audio: 
27:54-27:55
Yes.

System Audio: 
27:55-28:00
I don't actually...

System Audio: 
28:00-28:07
Do we want to just be very specific about this go expert and then...

System Audio: 
28:07-28:10
No, intermediate because we want them to learn two things.

System Audio: 
28:10-28:11
Yeah.

System Audio: 
28:11-28:14
I mean, expert will get us less people obviously.

System Audio: 
28:14-28:15
With an expert...

System Audio: 
28:15-28:20
In theory though, they might still just go ahead and do it anyway.

Microphone: 
28:16-28:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
28:20-28:21
Like still clients.

System Audio: 
28:21-28:22
They might, yeah.

System Audio: 
28:22-28:23
They might.

System Audio: 
28:23-28:24
I just...

System Audio: 
28:24-28:27
On Dart, we really want...

System Audio: 
28:27-28:28
We really want...

System Audio: 
28:28-28:29
Yeah.

System Audio: 
28:29-28:32
We want to test the people as well, don't we?

System Audio: 
28:32-28:33
So I...

System Audio: 
28:33-28:34
Yeah.

System Audio: 
28:34-28:35
We can do it and if nothing...

System Audio: 
28:35-28:40
If we're struggling for quality, we can always just redo it as expert.

System Audio: 
28:40-28:41
I think...

System Audio: 
28:41-28:42
Have we got...

System Audio: 
28:42-28:55
Maybe some experience with technical writing for...

Microphone: 
28:46-29:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
28:55-29:00
Something similar to what we do.

System Audio: 
29:00-29:01
Because it is...

System Audio: 
29:01-29:02
I think there's a...

System Audio: 
29:02-29:03
There is a...

System Audio: 
29:03-29:04
I mean writing...

System Audio: 
29:04-29:05
I could write about...

System Audio: 
29:05-29:06
I could write about...

System Audio: 
29:06-29:07
I could write about...

System Audio: 
29:07-29:08
I could write about...

System Audio: 
29:08-29:09
I could write about...

System Audio: 
29:09-29:10
UBO.

System Audio: 
29:10-29:11
I could write about...

System Audio: 
29:11-29:12
A security software company.

System Audio: 
29:12-29:13
Right?

System Audio: 
29:13-29:14
At an intermediate level.

System Audio: 
29:14-29:15
But it would be terrible.

System Audio: 
29:15-29:16
Yes.

System Audio: 
29:16-29:17
Compared to what we need.

Microphone: 
29:16-29:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
29:17-29:18
What we need for this.

System Audio: 
29:18-29:19
So...

System Audio: 
29:19-29:20
I wonder if we just need...

System Audio: 
29:20-29:22
This question here is one of them absolutely...

System Audio: 
29:22-29:23
Point...

System Audio: 
29:23-29:24
Really annoying questions.

System Audio: 
29:24-29:25
You get...

System Audio: 
29:25-29:26
Yeah.

System Audio: 
29:26-29:27
Describe when your writing has been successful.

System Audio: 
29:27-29:28
What?

System Audio: 
29:28-29:30
That's just such a stupid question.

System Audio: 
29:30-29:31
If you like, we can move it up to expert...

System Audio: 
29:31-29:32
Expert level.

System Audio: 
29:32-29:33
No, I know.

System Audio: 
29:33-29:34
I...

System Audio: 
29:34-29:35
I talked myself out to it again.

System Audio: 
29:35-29:36
I just...

System Audio: 
29:36-29:37
I just...

System Audio: 
29:37-29:38
I just...

System Audio: 
29:38-29:39
I don't know if...

System Audio: 
29:39-29:40
I don't know if it's...

System Audio: 
29:40-29:41
I just...

System Audio: 
29:41-29:42
You know...

System Audio: 
29:42-29:43
I don't know if it's...

System Audio: 
29:43-29:44
I don't know if it's...

System Audio: 
29:44-29:45
I don't know if it's...

System Audio: 
29:45-29:46
I don't know if it's...

System Audio: 
29:46-29:47
I don't know if it's...

Microphone: 
29:46-30:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
29:47-29:48
I don't know if it's...

System Audio: 
29:48-29:49
I don't know if it's...

System Audio: 
29:49-29:50
I don't know if it's...

System Audio: 
29:50-29:51
I don't know if it's...

System Audio: 
29:51-29:52
I don't know if it's...

System Audio: 
29:52-29:54
I talked myself out to it again.

System Audio: 
29:54-29:55
I just...

System Audio: 
29:55-29:56
I just...

System Audio: 
29:56-29:58
I suppose what I mean is that...

System Audio: 
29:58-30:00
They don't necessarily need to be expert,

System Audio: 
30:00-30:02
but having some...

System Audio: 
30:02-30:05
Experience in a similar...

System Audio: 
30:05-30:06
In a similar...

System Audio: 
30:06-30:08
Type of work.

System Audio: 
30:08-30:10
For what I mean is...

System Audio: 
30:10-30:15
Like, they could be a really good writer for technical content about...

System Audio: 
30:15-30:17
Password managers.

Microphone: 
30:16-30:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
30:17-30:18
Yeah.

System Audio: 
30:18-30:19
But...

System Audio: 
30:19-30:21
Would they be able to translate that into...

System Audio: 
30:21-30:23
Visual programming...

System Audio: 
30:23-30:24
Automation...

System Audio: 
30:24-30:25
Like...

System Audio: 
30:25-30:26
Like...

System Audio: 
30:26-30:27
Yeah...

System Audio: 
30:27-30:28
Like...

System Audio: 
30:28-30:29
That...

System Audio: 
30:29-30:30
The complexity of what we do...

System Audio: 
30:30-30:31
Yep.

System Audio: 
30:31-30:32
I suppose is what I'm...

System Audio: 
30:32-30:33
Thinking...

System Audio: 
30:33-30:34
Because...

System Audio: 
30:34-30:35
We can't afford them to learn this stuff.

System Audio: 
30:35-30:38
We can't be paying $50 an hour to learn.

System Audio: 
30:38-30:39
Yeah.

System Audio: 
30:39-30:41
So let's handle that on the...

System Audio: 
30:41-30:42
On the intake.

System Audio: 
30:42-30:44
Let's be quite strict on the intake.

System Audio: 
30:44-30:46
If we don't find someone that we're happy with, we'll just say no.

System Audio: 
30:46-30:48
I think that's something we should be.

Microphone: 
30:46-31:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
30:48-30:49
Yep.

System Audio: 
30:49-30:52
If these people are like, "Yeah, I can give it a shot."

System Audio: 
30:52-30:53
No, thank you.

System Audio: 
30:53-30:55
We need someone who's like, "Cool, I can do it."

System Audio: 
30:55-30:57
Yeah, this is what I've done in the past.

System Audio: 
30:57-30:58
Yeah.

System Audio: 
30:58-31:02
I think that'll help us get off to a bit more of our running start than...

System Audio: 
31:02-31:05
Trying to upscale them for the first two weeks of their $50 an hour.

System Audio: 
31:05-31:12
With anything with the English, I guess it's not that big a deal, but they need to write in English, so...

System Audio: 
31:12-31:15
Or like, cut people off, I don't know.

System Audio: 
31:15-31:19
Well, yeah, but I think it needs to be written in English.

Microphone: 
31:16-31:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
31:19-31:22
I would say it needs to be...

System Audio: 
31:22-31:25
I'm thinking fluent, really, because I just think that...

System Audio: 
31:25-31:27
Because this would...

System Audio: 
31:27-31:33
This category would, I guess, even cut off Boris if we say you have to be a native speaker, because he's not...

System Audio: 
31:33-31:35
So I guess fluent is better.

System Audio: 
31:35-31:37
Yeah, I think fluent...

System Audio: 
31:37-31:38
Yep.

System Audio: 
31:38-31:39
Yeah.

System Audio: 
31:39-31:40
Would he include himself?

System Audio: 
31:40-31:49
That's a big part of the psychology behind it.

Microphone: 
31:46-32:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
31:49-31:52
Sometimes you just see that.

System Audio: 
31:52-31:53
On your side.

System Audio: 
31:53-31:56
I know, for example, like in...

System Audio: 
31:56-32:01
Like my old job in Berlin, it's like, yeah, conversational German or better.

System Audio: 
32:01-32:04
I wouldn't have applied for it if I'd seen that.

System Audio: 
32:04-32:08
Even though I had the job for four years, like I would not have actually written myself into that.

System Audio: 
32:08-32:12
They say, apparently, having we talked about this in the past, Joe,

System Audio: 
32:12-32:15
Apparently, the way it works psychologically, the way it works is,

System Audio: 
32:15-32:19
Most males will just say they can do it, even if they can't.

Microphone: 
32:16-32:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
32:19-32:20
Yeah.

System Audio: 
32:20-32:24
And most females will be...

System Audio: 
32:24-32:31
If someone says you need to have this, and they're 90% there, they'll not press the button on it.

System Audio: 
32:31-32:37
So we'd definitely restrict our intake if we made it native or bilingual.

System Audio: 
32:37-32:39
Males are...

System Audio: 
32:39-32:41
If they have two out of ten skills, they'll apply.

System Audio: 
32:41-32:42
Yeah.

System Audio: 
32:42-32:45
And females, like if they have nine out of ten, they will.

System Audio: 
32:45-32:46
Which is mad.

System Audio: 
32:46-32:47
Yeah.

Microphone: 
32:46-33:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
32:47-32:48
It's interesting.

System Audio: 
32:48-32:52
So I think fluent is probably what's best to get the best chance of the higher intake.

System Audio: 
32:52-32:53
Okay.

System Audio: 
32:53-32:56
Hours a week, I guess we don't need to worry.

System Audio: 
32:56-32:57
Less than 30 hours a week.

System Audio: 
32:57-32:58
Yeah, it would be 20...

System Audio: 
32:58-32:59
20...

System Audio: 
32:59-33:00
20...

System Audio: 
33:00-33:01
20, wouldn't it be?

System Audio: 
33:01-33:02
Something like that.

System Audio: 
33:02-33:03
Yeah.

System Audio: 
33:03-33:04
No preference on this, really?

System Audio: 
33:04-33:05
An agency or an independent person?

System Audio: 
33:05-33:06
I've got no preference.

System Audio: 
33:06-33:07
If an agency can find us, somebody...

System Audio: 
33:07-33:08
No preference on the time, doesn't matter at all.

System Audio: 
33:08-33:10
A friend of mine recommended very specifically, you should hire someone from Sri Lanka.

System Audio: 
33:10-33:11
And I was like, that's such a specific one.

System Audio: 
33:11-33:11
And he was like, no, no, it's super, super cheap.

System Audio: 
33:11-33:11
They speak really good English and they're very good developers.

System Audio: 
33:11-33:11
So I'm not going to put a location thing on it.

System Audio: 
33:11-33:11
Do you think, see us saying 50 to 55 dollars, are we potentially pricing it too high?

System Audio: 
33:11-33:12
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:12-33:13
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:13-33:14
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:14-33:15
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:15-33:16
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:16-33:17
No, I don't think so.

Microphone: 
33:16-33:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
33:17-33:18
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:18-33:19
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:19-33:20
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:20-33:21
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:21-33:22
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:22-33:23
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:23-33:24
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:24-33:25
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:25-33:26
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:26-33:27
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:27-33:28
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:28-33:29
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:29-33:30
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:30-33:31
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:31-33:32
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:32-33:33
No, I don't think so.

System Audio: 
33:33-33:39
Are we potentially pricing it too high?

System Audio: 
33:39-33:41
No, I don't think so in this case.

System Audio: 
33:41-33:48
I think if we've got the budget, let's just aim for someone who's willing to go for that height, I think.

Microphone: 
33:46-34:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
33:48-33:51
Just wonder whether it should be, you know, subject to experience.

System Audio: 
33:51-33:54
So we might take someone on that we like, but maybe not.

System Audio: 
33:54-34:04
I'm just thinking if somebody would be happy to work for $40, still a good wage.

System Audio: 
34:04-34:05
I don't know.

System Audio: 
34:05-34:11
I'm just wondering if we are going to pay somebody who would work for $40 and be fantastic.

System Audio: 
34:11-34:12
$50.

System Audio: 
34:12-34:27
Yeah, and I don't mean that because I'm not worth that money.

Microphone: 
34:16-34:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
34:27-34:34
What I mean is I'm working for six months instead of three months if we got the same budget.

System Audio: 
34:34-34:38
Yeah, I mean, like if it was my personal money, I would think different.

System Audio: 
34:38-34:47
If we have the budget and we get the person, do we equally by the same coin, if we bring this money down, do we get rid of people that would have applied?

Microphone: 
34:46-35:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
34:47-34:49
Because I think, no, no, I'm not working for $40.

System Audio: 
34:49-34:55
So I wonder if we have a lower, a lower, a lower, yeah, bigger spread.

System Audio: 
34:55-35:01
So we've got the, so we have the, what I'm going to be saying, we're not trying to renegotiate with them.

System Audio: 
35:01-35:06
We are saying, you know, this was a spread and it's based on experience.

System Audio: 
35:06-35:07
Yeah.

System Audio: 
35:07-35:08
Yeah.

System Audio: 
35:08-35:17
I think down to $45 or down to $50?

Microphone: 
35:16-35:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
35:17-35:20
Yeah, I think maybe in the bit.

System Audio: 
35:20-35:21
Yeah.

System Audio: 
35:21-35:33
So what is the $40?

System Audio: 
35:33-35:33
What is the $40?

System Audio: 
35:33-35:34
What is the $40?

System Audio: 
35:34-35:34
What is the $40?

System Audio: 
35:34-35:48
And obviously Upwork would take about 8%.

Microphone: 
35:46-36:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
35:48-35:49
So $40, I mean $40 is $42.

System Audio: 
35:49-35:49
A lot of these are fixed.

System Audio: 
35:49-35:49
$42.

System Audio: 
35:49-35:49
A lot of these are quite fixed prices.

System Audio: 
35:49-35:50
Mm-hm.

System Audio: 
35:50-35:51
$42.

System Audio: 
35:51-35:52
A lot of these are quite fixed.

System Audio: 
35:52-35:52
A lot of these are quite fixed prices.

System Audio: 
35:52-35:52
Mm-hm.

System Audio: 
35:52-35:53
$42.

System Audio: 
35:53-35:54
Expert levels.

System Audio: 
35:54-35:54
I mean, just to put it in perspective, $40 is $66,000 a year.

System Audio: 
35:54-35:55
sterling.

System Audio: 
35:55-35:56
Yeah.

System Audio: 
35:56-35:56
Yeah.

System Audio: 
35:56-35:57
Yeah.

System Audio: 
35:57-35:58
So it's like $40.

System Audio: 
35:58-35:59
I don't know what it's like.

System Audio: 
35:59-36:00
I don't know what it's like.

System Audio: 
36:00-36:01
Yeah.

System Audio: 
36:01-36:02
It's like $40,000 a year.

System Audio: 
36:02-36:03
It's like $40.

System Audio: 
36:03-36:04
Yeah.

System Audio: 
36:04-36:05
It's like $40,000.

System Audio: 
36:05-36:06
Yeah.

System Audio: 
36:06-36:07
It's like $40.

System Audio: 
36:07-36:08
It's like $40.

System Audio: 
36:08-36:09
It's like $40.

System Audio: 
36:09-36:10
It's like $40,000.

System Audio: 
36:10-36:11
It's like $40,000.

System Audio: 
36:11-36:12
Yeah.

System Audio: 
36:12-36:13
Yeah.

System Audio: 
36:13-36:14
It's like $40,000.

System Audio: 
36:14-36:15
It's like $40,000.

System Audio: 
36:15-36:16
It's like $40,000.

System Audio: 
36:16-36:17
Yeah.

Microphone: 
36:16-36:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
36:17-36:18
It's like $40,000.

System Audio: 
36:18-36:19
It's like $40,000.

System Audio: 
36:19-36:20
I mean, it's like $40,000.

System Audio: 
36:20-36:21
It's like $40,000.

System Audio: 
36:21-36:22
It's like $40,000.

System Audio: 
36:22-36:23
It's like $40,000.

System Audio: 
36:23-36:24
It's like $40,000.

System Audio: 
36:24-36:25
Yeah.

System Audio: 
36:25-36:28
So it's like, I don't know what it's like.

System Audio: 
36:28-36:32
It's a contract and it's like only for three months and it's, they've got 8% taken off it.

System Audio: 
36:32-36:37
But even $40,000 is a good, very good salary.

System Audio: 
36:37-36:38
Okay.

System Audio: 
36:38-36:41
I'm just looking at the other ones here.

System Audio: 
36:41-36:42
Yeah.

System Audio: 
36:42-36:43
Okay.

System Audio: 
36:43-36:44
Okay.

System Audio: 
36:44-37:03
It's like a 51 to three months intermediate level.

Microphone: 
36:46-37:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
37:03-37:04
Okay.

System Audio: 
37:04-37:05
Okay.

System Audio: 
37:05-37:10
Okay.

System Audio: 
37:10-37:11
Okay.

System Audio: 
37:11-37:20
Do we want to let them know that there is an opportunity that they could become?

Microphone: 
37:16-37:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
37:20-37:22
Thanks for charging me.

System Audio: 
37:22-37:23
No.

System Audio: 
37:23-37:25
Not at this time.

System Audio: 
37:25-37:26
Be a person.

System Audio: 
37:26-37:27
Okay.

System Audio: 
37:27-37:28
I mean, it's-

System Audio: 
37:28-37:31
No, we don't miss about here, Joe.

System Audio: 
37:31-37:32
Make it happen.

System Audio: 
37:32-37:34
We'll just get it done.

System Audio: 
37:34-37:35
What is this?

System Audio: 
37:35-37:39
We'll be like three weeks worth of red tape and are we sure that's what we want every day?

System Audio: 
37:39-37:43
Well, we, I always say if we get to this meeting, we've already decided we are.

System Audio: 
37:43-37:44
Yeah.

System Audio: 
37:44-37:45
Um.

System Audio: 
37:45-37:46
No, it's just a sort of refreshing.

System Audio: 
37:46-37:52
Like I was talking to a mate last night just going, I'm just, everybody just seems to get stuff done.

Microphone: 
37:46-38:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
37:52-37:55
Like I messaged me about something yesterday and she was like, "Oh, I've already done it.

System Audio: 
37:55-37:56
I've seen it yet.

System Audio: 
37:56-37:57
We'll be here for 45.

System Audio: 
37:57-37:58
Done."

System Audio: 
37:58-37:59
Yeah.

System Audio: 
37:59-38:00
Yeah.

System Audio: 
38:00-38:01
Yeah.

System Audio: 
38:01-38:04
So it's just like everybody just seems to actually do their jobs and just get things done.

System Audio: 
38:04-38:05
That's what it's very good.

System Audio: 
38:05-38:08
I'm a big proponent of just pulling the trade there.

System Audio: 
38:08-38:09
Yeah.

System Audio: 
38:09-38:12
Very four-year identity before we can do this.

System Audio: 
38:12-38:14
Can I leave this part with you?

System Audio: 
38:14-38:15
I have to go at 12.

System Audio: 
38:15-38:16
Yeah.

System Audio: 
38:16-38:22
I can get the billing stuff if that's all it is.

Microphone: 
38:16-38:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
38:22-38:25
Have you guys checked if you can log in yet?

System Audio: 
38:25-38:29
No, if it is anything more than just billing, we'll have to circle back around.

System Audio: 
38:29-38:30
Yeah.

System Audio: 
38:30-38:31
Let's check.

System Audio: 
38:31-38:32
I'll see if I can log in.

System Audio: 
38:32-38:35
Yeah, you can log in and everything like that.

System Audio: 
38:35-38:36
Yeah.

System Audio: 
38:36-38:41
I've just got a doubt in my mind about $40.

System Audio: 
38:41-38:44
I wonder whether we should have a bit lower.

System Audio: 
38:44-38:53
Um, just to give us the, just to give us the, um, it might, it might too if Amy.

Microphone: 
38:46-39:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
38:53-38:54
Yeah.

System Audio: 
38:54-38:55
Done.

System Audio: 
38:55-38:56
No, no, I went.

System Audio: 
38:56-38:57
I went okay.

System Audio: 
38:57-38:58
Okay, great.

System Audio: 
38:58-38:59
You can also obviously edit that job then whenever.

System Audio: 
38:59-39:04
I would, I'm looking at the other ones, they all, they seem quite different.

System Audio: 
39:04-39:09
You might want to edit the job description with a slightly more, I've never really written

System Audio: 
39:09-39:10
a job description, so.

System Audio: 
39:10-39:17
Yeah, they need, yeah, government issued photo ID appear on camera, something like for

Microphone: 
39:16-39:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
39:17-39:18
inventory review.

System Audio: 
39:18-39:22
What have I got to do?

System Audio: 
39:22-39:23
Cool.

System Audio: 
39:23-39:32
Uh, so what we'll do, I'll put something in the calendar for like, this time I'll do it

System Audio: 
39:32-39:35
for early next week, just so we can say, okay, what happened over the weekend?

System Audio: 
39:35-39:36
Do we have people in already?

System Audio: 
39:36-39:37
Yeah.

System Audio: 
39:37-39:41
And then we'll set like a, maybe a more regular, just whilst we get it off the ground.

System Audio: 
39:41-39:45
I'm sure we won't all need to be present every single time, but let's just start that way

System Audio: 
39:45-39:49
and see how we, see how it plays out.

Microphone: 
39:46-40:16
Thank you.

System Audio: 
39:49-40:06
I'll do it on, yeah I'll do it on Tuesday.

System Audio: 
40:06-40:07
Yeah, that sounds good.

System Audio: 
40:07-40:15
Right, I will go and speak to Brad/Mel and there might be a bit of a delay in just getting

System Audio: 
40:15-40:18
this all okay, but I'll go and speak to him after this call.

Microphone: 
40:16-40:46
Thank you.

System Audio: 
40:18-40:21
Yeah, when you said 12, that means one minute done doesn't it?

System Audio: 
40:21-40:23
Yeah, I'll just go jump into it.

System Audio: 
40:23-40:29
What I'll do is get some list of content we actually want to kick off with.

System Audio: 
40:29-40:30
Yeah.

System Audio: 
40:30-40:31
From the engineering side.

System Audio: 
40:31-40:34
I also have two ideas for videos I'm going to make next week in Berlin, so we'll start the

System Audio: 
40:34-40:35
train moving again soon.

System Audio: 
40:35-40:36
Awesome.

System Audio: 
40:36-40:41
We don't have some money behind them, but let's see how it goes.

System Audio: 
40:41-40:42
Good stuff.

System Audio: 
40:42-40:43
Great talk.

System Audio: 
40:43-40:44
Cool.
