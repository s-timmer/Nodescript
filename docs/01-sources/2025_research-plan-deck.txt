NodeScript User Research Plan — slide deck (11 pages). Source: PDF upload.

External user research methodology and plan.

Context:
- 436 signups, 11.7% activation rate at time of planning
- Developer-first strategy confirmed
- Need to validate assumptions with external developers

Three Hypotheses to Validate:
1. Technical users (developers/engineers) who work with APIs find NodeScript valuable for rapid prototyping and automation
2. The visual programming paradigm reduces time-to-value compared to traditional coding for integration tasks
3. Users who successfully complete their first workflow become regular users

Target Group:
- Developers and technical users who work with APIs/integrations
- Have tried workflow automation tools but found them limiting
- Comfortable with some coding but want faster execution
- Age range: 25-45, various experience levels

Recruitment Strategy:
- LinkedIn outreach
- Reddit communities (r/webdev, r/automation, r/node)
- Existing survey respondents who showed interest
- Paid interviews at €100/voucher

Research Format:
- Semi-structured interviews (60 min)
- Show-and-tell: participants demo their current workflow tools
- Landing page prototype testing: gauge first impressions
- Two-part design: (1) understand workflows/pain points, (2) introduce NodeScript value prop

Key Learning Goals:
- Current pain points in API integration/automation workflow
- How developers currently solve problems NodeScript could address
- First impressions of NodeScript's visual approach
- Whether AI features resonate independently (not prompted)
